A puzzle-based management game.

## DEVELOPER DIARY
Started with a dream of blending my three favorite mobile game series:
Rebuild (1 and 3) - the community and base management, encroaching enemies
Puzzle Forge I and II - puzzle crafting mechanic
Merchant - outfit heroes with gear, send them on missions; no direct control

Loved the simple UI from Merchant. Found this article on page changes:

Thanks to Hans Muller. Used this code as the foundation of my UI.
Gutted the things I didn't need.

TODO: LEARN ABOUT PERSISTING DATA BETWEEN PAGE CHANGES + APP CLOSURE
GlobalKey?
shared_preferences package? use this for local app settings (dark mode)
--how much data is "a lot"? 
--look into 'hive' for game storage
